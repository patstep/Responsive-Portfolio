      <p> I earned my bachelor degree in linguistics at Montclair State University in 2012 and have since been teaching at a Polish supplementary school in Jersey City, and tutoring students privately in English as a second language.  </p>
    <br>
    <p> Currently I am finishing my master's degree in urban education with certification in teaching ESL at New Jersey City University. </p>
    <br>
    <p> My interest in coding and programming was sparked by a computational linguistics course at Montclair, but I have not taken up the challenge of learning to code until now.  With the encouragement of my best friend, who finished the Rutgers bootcamp last year, I took the chance and signed up for an opportunity to develop a new skill set and start a new career.  </p>
